                The 2022 Mustang Mach-E is available with either a standard-range 70.0-kWh battery or an extended-range 91.0-kWh pack. These feed an electric motor mounted on the rear or both axles. That latter combination creates all-wheel drive, and on the sporty GT and GT Performance models, the motors combine to make 480 horsepower and up to 634 pound-feet of torque. The GT Performance model we tested hit 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, but it didn't fully live up to our expectations. Less powerful models make between 266 and 346 horses and between 317 and 428 pound-feet. The Mach-E rides on wheels that range in size from 18 to 20 inches, and it can be had with adaptive dampers for adjustable ride firmness. The version we drove was an extended-range, all-wheel-drive model that was quick and better to drive than most ordinary crossovers. However, drivers shouldn't expect the Mach-E to be nearly as engaging as the traditional Mustang. Its quiet operation and super-smooth ride were most impressive.

                The 2022 Mustang Mach-E has an EPA-estimated range of between 211 and 305 miles, depending on the battery pack and type of electric motors, which isn't nearly as impressive as the rangiest Tesla models. Every model also has fast-charging capability. Every Mach-E comes out of the box with a Ford mobile charger that can add up to 30 miles of range per night with a 120-volt outlet and up to 80 percent of battery life overnight with a 240-volt outlet. A Ford charge station can also be ordered online and installed by certified electricians, with the ability to replenish 32 miles per hour and recharge the battery overnight.

                The range-topping Mustang Mach-E with rear-wheel drive and the extended range battery boasts an EPA-estimated range of 305 miles. The all-wheel-drive version with the extended battery has an estimated driving range of 270 miles. However, there are a wider variety of ranges depending on the model and equipment. The Mach-E with the larger battery that we tested on our 75-mph highway fuel-economy route, which is part of our extensive testing regimen, went 250 miles on a single charge. Based on the increased capacity for 2022, we think it'll add about 8 miles of real-world highway range. For more information about the Mustang Mach-E's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.

                The Mustang Mach-'s battery is located under the floor of the car, which allows for maximum cargo and passenger space. Unlike its exterior, the inside of the Mach-E has little in common with the regular Mustang. Its streamlined dashboard hosts an attractive digital gauge cluster and is dominated by a huge vertically mounted touchscreen. A floating, flip-up armrest on the center console allows a purse or other items to be stored between the front-seat passengers. There are also many slick features that include customizable ambient interior lighting, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless charging, a panoramic sunroof, and more. The front trunk is made of durable plastics that can be rinsed and then drained, which allows storing ice and messy things. The Mach-E has 29 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, and up to 60 with the back seats folded.

                Ford's next-generation SYNC infotainment system uses machine learning to fully customize each driver's experienceâ€”currently it supports three driver profiles and one guest. The Mustang Mach-E runs the software through a vertically mounted 15.5-inch touchscreen that allows for easy access to the system's array of apps and features. A benefit of the system is that Ford will roll out over-the-air updates over time, constantly improving the system and adding new content. Top features include Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot, and a Bang & Olufsen audio system.
