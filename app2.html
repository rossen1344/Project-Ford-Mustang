          <section class="text1">
          <p>Early in the GT500's development, it was decided that the latest Shelby creation would not come standard with the 427 cubic-inch V8 of GT40 fame. Instead, the GT500 featured a 428 cubic-inch V8 “Police Interceptor” powerplant. This engine would be modified to increase output, and provide the magnitude of performance that Shelby envisioned for the GT500.

            This 428 cubic-inch V8 was typically reserved for use in larger, full-size Ford vehicles. However, Shelby found it to be ideal for use in the GT500, with the addition of a few minor mechanical tweaks. Shelby fitted this engine with a medium-rise aluminum intake manifold, as well as twin Holley 600-cfm 4-barrel carburetors. In its refined form, the 427 cubic-inch V8 was conservatively rated as producing 355 bhp. However, many have surmised that the engine's true output was much higher.

            Contrary to the 428 V8's status as the standard engine of the GT500, at least several 427 V8 equipped Shelby's were known to have been produced. While the number of such factory-produced, race-ready GT500's is said to be extremely low, subsequent dealer modifications of this variety are thought to be much higher.

            When purchasing a GT500, consumers were able to select between the standard 4-speed, RUGS-1 manual transmission, or a 3-speed automatic alternative. Power was directed through a 3.50 Traction-Lok rear end.

            The GT500 was also fitted with stiffer front springs, an upgraded anti-roll bar, and Gabriel shock absorbers. Front disc brakes also came standard on the GT500, enabling drivers to better manage the immense power which the Shelby provided.<p>
          <p>From its initial development, the GT500 was intended to stand out from any other Mustang derived vehicle on the road. As such, significant thought was placed into its exterior design. In part, Carrol Shelby intended to bring value to the GT500 for its originality, outside of that which consumers could find in the Mustang's base model.

            The Shelby GT500 featured an elongated fiberglass front end, with a sizable grille, onto which high beam headlights were centrally mounted. However, these lights were found to each side of the GT500's grille in a number of instances, as dictated by state motor vehicle regulations. A fiberglass hood sported a pair of functional hood scoops, which directed airflow to the Shelby's engine.
            
            Also of note was the Shelby line's signature rocker panel striping, which included “Cobra” badging on all GT500 models. A total of four body-side, functional air intakes further bolstered the GT500's signature look.
            
            Moving rearward, the GT500 featured a fiberglass deck lid, complete with an easily recognizable molded spoiler. The famed Shelby's sequential taillights were borrowed from prior Cougar production and served as a way to differentiate the GT500's looks from that of the base model Mustang.</p>
          <p>For all its performance prowess, the Shelby GT500's interior design more aptly embodied the feel of a high-end cruiser. The vehicle utilized Ford's GT-level interior trim, which included a wood-rimmed, three-spoke steering wheel. The GT500's dash was of polished metal composition and housed an 8,000 RPM tach and a 140 MPH speedometer.

            The GT500 could be ordered with black or parchment color interior and featured Cobra badging at the center of its steering wheel, as well as on the passenger side dash. Also included was a back seat, which could be folded down to provide additional cargo space.
              
            Of additional note was the GT500's inclusion of a standard two-point, padded roll bar, much like that which was featured in the GT350. Optional air conditioning was also available to consumers, at an additional cost.</p>
          <p>The Shelby GT500's release signaled a wave of change for subsequent high-output Mustang production. While the GT350 once stood as the premier Shelby performer, it would slowly begin taking a back seat to the more robust GT500. This would be further exemplified in the year to follow, when the GT350 would have its output significantly cut, as its 289 cubic-inch powerplant was removed as a standard offering. For all intents and purposes, the GT500 now stood head and shoulders above all other vehicles within the Shelby line.</p>

          <p>For the 1969 year model, the GT500 again received a restyled front fascia, which was further extended over that of previous year models. The GT500's grille and headlight buckets were shrouded with chrome trim, and its rectangular driving lights were relocated to their new position below the car's front bumper.

            The GT500's hood was a particular point of interest, as it now featured three individual air scoops that were arranged in a triangular layout. Air scoops also adorned each of the GT500's front fenders, just in front of their respective wheel wells.
            
            Also present was the GT500's signature striping, which spanned the vehicle's length on each side. The “GT 500” logo was displayed within this striping, in the margin between the car's bumper and front air scoops. Rear air scoops were also found along the leading edge of each rear fender.</p>
          <p>The GT500's rear end featured a low-rise integrated rear spoiler, attached to its deck lid. Underneath this spoiler, was the “Shelby” logo, backed by a matte black finish. Sequential turn signals were also utilized to round out the GT500's appearance.</p>
          <p>The Shelby GT500 once again utilized Ford's Deluxe interior package for the 1969 model year. This package included high-back seats, as well as simulated wood grain accents, which spanned the car's dash, door panels, and center console. A three-spoke wood-rimmed steering wheel also came standard.

            The GT500's dash featured a large tachometer and speedometer. However, this resulted in the removal of the car's ammeter and oil pressure gauges. In a bid to retain the use of these gauges, both were relocated to a new position directly below the GT500's radio. Fog light and interior light switches were located to the rear of the vehicle's shifter, mounted atop the center console.
              
            Also present was the GT500's signature two-point padded roll bar, which included inertia-reel harnesses in all hardtop models. Alternatively, convertible GT500s featured standard cross-shoulder restraints.</p>
          <p>For the 1969 production year, the GT500 retained its prior 428 Cobra Jet powerplant. This engine featured heavy-duty police interceptor connecting rods, 427 “low-riser” cylinder heads, and hydraulic camshafts. The Cobra Jet's iron intake manifold was topped with a Holley 735-cfm four-barrel carburetor.

            The Cobra Jet equipped GT500 was rated at 335 HP, and 440 lb-ft of torque, which were quite robust figures during the era in which this iconic Mustang was built. The 1969 Shelby GT500 was capable of posting 0-60 MPH times of approximately 6-seconds and could complete a ¼ mile pull in approximately 16 seconds.
            
            This power was directed through a four-speed Ford Toploader transmission or an optional C6 automatic. The GT500 also came equipped with Traction-Lok limited-slip rear axles.</p>
          <p>For all intents and purposes, the 1969 model year served as the Shelby GT500's final stand. Though unsold units would continue to be marketed for the 1970 model year, no new Shelby production took place after 1969. Just as Carrol Shelby himself had moved on to new projects of his own, the time was right for the next chapter in Mustang production to begin. While the curtain had fallen on the Shelby GT500, its legendary status lives on today.</p>

        <p>1971 saw another major restyling change for the Mustang. It was also to be the last restyling for the first generation Mustang. Introduced late in August of 1970, the new Mustang certainly looked different. While maintaining a basic resemblance to previous Mustangs, the 1971 Mustangs were the largest and heaviest yet.

          The body gained weight and other dimensions faster than you could say stop! It was more than two inches longer and almost two and a half inches wider than it's 1970 predecessor. For the first time since the Mustang's inception, the wheelbase was extended one inch to 109″. In fact Lee Iacocca called it a “fat pig”.
          
          The car had to gain width and length to accommodate the new 429 dynamo being installed in it. Over 400 pounds were added in one year! Yet, if you did not order the monster engine, the smaller engines were still hampered by the increase in weight and size.
          
          Ford still built the Mustang in three configurations: hardtop, convertible and SportsRoof.</p>
        <p>The design was mocked up by Gail Halderman and shown to Ford's then president “Bunkie” Knudsen. Bunkie liked the design and approved it. Sad news however because of his racing and performance tastes, he was removed from office. It seems like the upper echelon didn't share his tastes and were caving in to the underpowered and ugly “econostang” being readied for 1974.

          On the SportsRoof, the rear window angle was only fourteen degrees from horizontal- this resulted in a cleaner aerodynamic look, but it was harder to see out. It also meant that rear window slats were no longer offered. Probably because if you put slats on the rear window your view of the stars would be blocked. Also, because you set low in the seats, and it was hard to see over the long hood and rear end.
            
          Also on the exterior, the famous Mustang corral returned. A new wide chrome strip on the edge of the front fenders and hood was borrowed from the 1969 Shelby's. The long hood now turned up at the windshield to cover the hidden wipers. Large, bold, triple lens tail lights appeared on the rear of the new Mustang. Flush mounted door handles replaced the earlier surface mounted units.
            
          If you ordered the top of the line 429 ram air package, you got the functional hood scoops, all others got a simulated hood scoop. Again, if you wanted to pay for functionality there was a price and if you had a 351 engine, you could buy the Ram Air hood package. This Dual Ram Induction option consisted of a hood with two functional NASA type hood scoops, twist type hood locks, a Tu-Tone paint treatment, and black or argent and Ram Air decals. It made any Mustang look better but really didn't do much as far performance goes.</p>
        <p>The interior was redesigned as well. The dash used a three pod arrangement, and for the first time, power windows and a defroster were optional. There were two interior options, the Decor Group and the Mach 1 Sports Interior, which was optional on any SportsRoof Mustang. The interior also featured standard high-back buckets, a mini console, and an all new instrumentation layout.

          The deluxe interior on the Mach 1 was not standard this year. If you wanted class you bought it at a price of about $130. The deluxe hood was a Mach 1 option if you ordered the engine upgrade.</p>
          <p>The 200 cubic inch 6 cylinder was dropped along with the 428, the Boss 302, and the Boss 429. New engines for 1971 were the Boss 351, the 429, and the Ram Air 429. Base engine on all models was the 250 c.i. six cylinder, except the Mach 1 which came with the 210 hp 302 V8.

            All of the 351 engines (series 335) used in the Mustangs were manufactured at the Cleveland plant. In May of '71, the 351 CJ engine design changed somewhat. The compression was lowered and the horsepower decreased as well. The latter engine was rated 5 horsepower less at 280 horsepower. Both engines were designated with the letter “M” on the door plates.
            
            The 302 V8 didn't provide much punch for a heavier Mustang. Optional V8s were the 210 hp 302, 240 hp 351, 285 hp 351, 370 hp 429, 375 hp 429. All 351 V-8s were Clevelands. In May 1971, a low compression 280hp 351, called the 351CJ, replaced the 285 hp 351 V-8 that was available at the beginning of the model year. Both of these 351s had the same engine code, M.
            
            With the 427 and 428 engines now history, the replacement 429 CJ engine was called for duty as the top Mustang engine. Although the 429s were available on any Mustang body style, the big engine was most often seen in the Mach 1, which was still the main Mustang performance model. The 429 belonged to the Ford 385 Engine Series and as such, no parts were interchangeable with the older 428. Wider, larger, and heavier, the 429 would not readily fit into the 1970 Mustang engine compartment, which is one of the reasons why the 1971 Mustang got bigger. The cylinder block was a variation of the 429/460 block, of which the Boss 429 was also based on; the cylinder heads were similar to the 351 Cleveland in design. You could describe the 429 as a large Boss 302. The 429CJ became a 429SCJ if the Drag Pack option was ordered.</p>

          <p>1973 brought the last year of the “big” Mustang, the last of the first generation Mustangs. It was going to be replaced by a smaller, lighter Mustang and Ford was focused on getting that ready, therefore, most of the changes for 1973 were purely cosmetic. A large, square, chrome headlamp bezel appeared, as did chrome trim around the tail lights. A color keyed Urethane front bumper replaced the chrome units of the previous years. The front parking lights were now placed vertically in the front grille.

            A new, grained, black applique with bright trim was placed on the rear body panel between the tail lights. This was replaced with a honeycomb style on the Mach 1 and Grande models. The 1973 Mustang convertible was to become the last Mustang convertible for many years.
            
            This was also a year of first for Mustang It was the first year where FORD did not restyle the mustang after 2 model years, it was the first of many years to come where horsepower and performance steadily declined. It was the first to start engine cubic inches in a decline. The next generation of Mustangs known as Mustang II's would become smaller and “broken” to use a horse term. The next performance car Ford will make will be in 20 years in 1983 when they make a GT with a Holley 4bbl carburetor. I had a 1968 coupe 302 2bbl, 1966 289 GT fastback and 1967 289 4bbl, 4-speed dark green convertible. These would remain my only mustangs until 1983 I vowed not to step backwards and buy an under performing Mustang no matter how much repair work needed to be done to keep the old ones running!
            
            The 1973 Mustang resembled the 1971 and 1972 Mustangs very closely. In most respects, they were unchanged. The most obvious change was the redesigned grille. The egg crate mesh was larger and the turn signal lamps were located within the grille opening. Headlight location remained unchanged, however, the headlight bezels were chromed and similarly, the taillight bezels were finished in bright metal. The front bumpers were different (modified to meet the new federal crash standards), front fenders are different, grille is different. However, if you look casually at the cars, the average person will not distinguish one year from another. The grill had the turn signals mounted in the outside part of the grille.
            
            Headlight bezels and taillight bezels were bright metal, not color coordinated or flat black. The chrome lip on the front of the hood was color keyed as were the front fender extensions, in previous years, they were mostly chrome. The standard running horse in the grille is enclosed in a a corral and has a vertical bar going up and down like the '65 Mustang. The whole grille assembly is surrounded in a shiny chrome colored metal rectangular corral as well. The Mustang script on the front fenders remains unchanged from previous years.
            
            Bumpers and bumper mountings were modified and the urethane front bumper became standard, and was enlarged in accordance with new NHTSA standards. The bumper was color-keyed to the car's paint as were the hood and fender moldings. The rear bumper, similar to the 1971-72 unit, was mounted further away from the rear of the car in order to comply with the 2-1/2 mph rear standards.
            
            Engine availability was largely unchanged from 1972. The main change was Ford no longer offering the 351 HO engine. You could get the 351 4bbl and 351 2bbl as an upgrade to the 302. Even though it was the last year for the big Mustang, some mechanical improvements did appear. Suspension travel was increased by a 1/4 inch and the standard drum brakes were larger. And all convertibles came with power front disc brakes.
            
            The Lee Iacocca Mustang II will make its debut in “74 and thereafter for the next 4 years. Goodbye to the first generation Mustangs.</p>
          <p>The 1973 Mustang resembled the 1971 and 1972 Mustangs very closely. The 1973 Mustang had grown up, out and heavy since its birth in 1964. Wheelbase increased by 1 inch, it was 12.2 inches longer and 5.9 inches wider. In height it grew .4 inches and total weight increased by 575 pounds. Although 575 pounds does not seem to be much, since the original car only weighed 2562 pounds, this was about 22% increase.</p>
          <p>The 1973 Eleanor was a movie car from the independent filmmaker H.B. “Toby” Halicki's 1974 film Gone in 60 Seconds. It was actually a 1971 Mustang in 1973 Mach 1 trim. Two Eleanor cars were used in the movie, a “beauty” version for close-up shots, and a stunt version used for the high speed chase scene. The high speed chase scene is considered one of the best movie car-chase scenes of all time. Another is the the movie “Bullitt” which featured a 1968 Mustang!
